# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website.
At the moment it is just static html, css, but there are plans to develop towards Razor Pages + HTML.

## Principals

- Should give an idea of who I am
- Should express my personal opinion
- Should contain all the public up to date contacts I have
- Simple, clean, minimalist design
- Timeless design
- Fast
- Clarity
- Online accessibility
- SEO-friendly
- Should be up-to-date
- All information for HRs should be on a separate page

## TODO

- Add Blog
- Switch to Razor Pages
- Add page for HR
- Deploy to VPS
- Maybe Dark Theme
- Maybe add 2 docs split layout
